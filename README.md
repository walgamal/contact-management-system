# EpitecCMSApp

I used Blazor Server and EF Core to create a Contact Management System (CMS) in Visual Studio.

Contact Entities allow the user to do the following:

•	Users can view a list of contacts 

•	Users can add a contact 

•	Users can edit a contact 

•	Users can delete a contact 

Additionally, Users cannot enter empty data for the first and last name input fields. The CMS will prompt the user to enter a value if the fields are left empty upon submission.
